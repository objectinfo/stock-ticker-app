# Stock Ticker App
## Made by: Justin Choi

Hi there! Simple stock visualization app that I made focusing on ____ stock just for simplicity, but obviously it could be scaled to something larger. Just made it small as a code sample to submit, but if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me! The scripts are as follows to run the app: 

- Clone it to your own computer
- `npm start`: will run it on `localhost:3000`
- `npm run build`: will rebuild the application so that you can see any changes made
